This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data2<-read.csv("classeur4.csv", header=T, sep=";")
head(data2)
tail(data2)
```
```{r}
data2.zoo=zoo(data2[,-1], order.by=as.Date(strptime(as.character(data2[,1]), "%Y/%m/%d")))
head(data2.zoo)
```
```{r}
est3 <- VAR(data2.zoo, p = 2, type = "const")
head(est3)
```
```{r}
spilloverDY09(est3, n.ahead = 100, no.corr = F)
spilloverDY12(est3, n.ahead = 100, no.corr = F)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
